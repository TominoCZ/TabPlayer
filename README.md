# Tab Player

***I couldn't find any good free solution that is convenient enough so I built my own.***

Here's a list of handy features my little creation supports:

- Live editing
- Custom instruments **(in intruments.json)**
- Custom note octaves in the tab itself (such as E4, G#2, ...)
- Unlimited amount of strings (lines)
- Much more

The program plays the tab with the standard tuning of the selected instrument unless you override the tuning in the tab itself per string (check gif and yes, both notes 'B' and 'H' work)

The program is primarily made to play Guitar tabs or tabs for any other string instrument but in theory you can always have it play any instrument you like if you add it in.

***I've included some tabs you can test it with in the TABS folder.***
